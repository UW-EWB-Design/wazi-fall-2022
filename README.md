# EWB/WAZI Collaboration - Winter 2021

This project started development for WAZI's website redesign, using **Vue.js** and **TailwindCSS**, based on a previously made [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/QRVrR5BHyJPY4QGnqJwLwF/Wazi-Collab---EWB?node-id=607%3A813).

Two pages were developed: the 'Home' page and the 'Assessment History' page. 

The 'Home' page has two components: one that lists the user's recent assessments, and another that lists the user's recent therapy sessions. 

Currently, on the 'Assessment History' page, only the severity label of the advanced filter works (the other options will not change the list at all).  

### Future Improvements
* Implement full filter functionality for all the advanced filter options on the 'Assessment History' page. 
* Start and complete development for the 'Assessment Details' page.
* Connect the application to access objects in backend instead of listing all components in pre-defined arrays.
